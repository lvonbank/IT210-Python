# Finds cars total cost
For car compute the following
    fuel consumed = miles driven / fuel efficiency
    fuel cost = price per gallon * fuel consumed
    maintenance = miles driven * .05 cent
    total cost 1 = maintenance + fuel cost

# Finds trains total cost
For train compute the following
    total cost 2 = train ticket

if total cost 1 < total cost 2
    car
else
    train
