P5_6.py

P5_18.py (MUST use recursion)

P5_22.py (Call your function from a main function that reads initialBalance, interestRate, years (in that order) and prints the result.  For interest rate, use 0.05 for 5%.

P5_25.py (Note that printBarCode computes the check digit, and calls printDigit for each digit that must be printed. Implement a main that will get a zip code using input and will call printBarCode to print the resulting pattern using : and |.

P5_34.py (Write a main function that will use input to get r1, r2 and h (in that order), call the functions described and print both answers, labeled, on a single line.)
